# ACES - Virtual Working Group - Gamut Mapping - 2020

This repository hosts, in a version controlled location, a snapshot of the research and development effort of the [ACES Virtual Working Group on Gamut Mapping - 2020](https://community.acescentral.com/t/new-aces-working-group-gamut-mapping/).

The Virtual Working Group proposal can be read in this [document](https://community.acescentral.com/uploads/short-url/kax9E4X8dTMd9PkASqL7bz7S4qU.pdf).

A [Dropbox Workspace](https://aces.mp/GamutVWGDocs) is available as the central location for sharing resources.

## Model

The gamut mapping model selected by the Virtual Working Group is based on
[Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model](#smith-2020---rgb-saturation-study-model).

The following implementations are expected to be available in the [model](model)
directory:

- DCTL for [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)
- BlinkScript Kernel for [The Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke)
- CTL for [The Color Transformation Language](https://github.com/ampas/CTL)

## Research

The [research](research) directory contains a mix of useful resources pertaining
to research, experimentation and analysis conducted by the Virtual Working Group.

### Gamut Mapping Study Models

#### Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model

[Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/rgb-saturation-gamut-mapping-approach-and-a-comp-vfx-perspective/) is built on top of the [RGB colourspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_spaces_with_RGB_primaries) with the following approach:

- An achromatic axis is computed for the scene-referred RGB exposure values.
- The pseudo-distance between the individual ùëÖ, ùê∫ and ùêµ components and the achromatic axis is compressed with a cherry-picked compression function.

The model is extremely simple and elegant while offering good computational speed.

The following implementations are available:

##### [jedypod/gamut-compress](research/repositories/jedypod/gamut-compress)

Provides DCC implementation for [The Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke) and [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/).

Please refer to the repository [README.md](https://github.com/jedypod/gamut-compress/README.md) file for more information.

##### [colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings](research/repositories/colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings)

Provides Python implementation via Jupyter Notebooks.

Please refer to the repository [README.rst](https://github.com/colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings/README.rst) file for more information.

#### Mansencal and Scharfenberg (2020) HSV Control Based Study Model

[Mansencal and Scharfenberg (2020) HSV Control Based Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/gamut-mapping-in-cylindrical-and-conic-spaces/) is built on top of the
[HSV colourspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) with the following
approach:

- Scene-referred RGB exposure values are converted to HSV.
- The saturation component ùëÜ is compressed with a cherry-picked compression function.
- The hue component ùêª is warped according to user defined control values.
- The HSV values are converted back to scene-referred RGB exposure values and then blended with the original scene-referred RGB exposure values function through a smoothstep function.

The model is much more complex and slower but offers direct controls over hue.

The following implementations are available:

##### [colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings](research/repositories/colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings)

Provides Python implementation via Jupyter Notebooks.

Please refer to the repository [README.rst](https://github.com/colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings/README.rst) file for more information.

#### Johnson (2020) ARRI Gamut Mapping Study Model

[Johnson (2020) ARRI Gamut Mapping Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/gamut-mapping-method-nuke-script-example/) is focusing on ARRI colourspaces
while adopting some principles from Smith (2020) model.

The following implementations are available:

##### [johnson322/ArriGamutMapping](research/repositories/johnson322/ArriGamutMapping)

Provides DCC implementation for [The Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke).

Please refer to the repository [README.md](https://github.com/johnson322/ArriGamutMapping/blob/master/README.md) file for more information.
