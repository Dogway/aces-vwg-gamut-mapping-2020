# ACES - Virtual Working Group - Gamut Mapping - 2020

This repository hosts, in a version controlled location, a snapshot of the research and development effort of the [ACES Virtual Working Group on Gamut Mapping - 2020](https://community.acescentral.com/t/new-aces-working-group-gamut-mapping/).

The Virtual Working Group proposal can be read in this [document](https://community.acescentral.com/uploads/short-url/kax9E4X8dTMd9PkASqL7bz7S4qU.pdf).

A [Dropbox Workspace](https://aces.mp/GamutVWGDocs) is available as the central location for sharing resources.

## Reference Implementations

In order to make the ACES 1.3 **Reference Gamut Compression** available prior to its wider native implementation in DCCs, a set of implementations in various forms is available in the [reference](./reference) folder of this repo.

These implementations are intended only as a stop-gap, and should be considered deprecated once the algorithm is either implemented natively in a particular DCC, or OCIO 2.1+ is supported.

## Installation

```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/colour-science/aces-vwg-gamut-mapping-2020.git
    $ cd aces-vwg-gamut-mapping-2020
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Model

The gamut mapping model selected by the Virtual Working Group is based on
[Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model](#smith-2020---rgb-saturation-study-model).

The following implementations are available in the [model](model) directory:

- BlinkScript Kernel for [The Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke)
- DCTL for [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)
- Fuse for [Fusion Studio](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/fusion/)
- Matchbox GLSL for [Autodesk Flame & Smoke](https://www.autodesk.com/products/flame/)
- Nuke Script for [The Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke)
- Python Script for [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

## Default Parameter Values
This [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZMSQhyhXtAYQXfop6qhifXudDiPu4eTV?usp=sharing) shows calculations for the threshold values needed to protect the colors of the ColorChecker24, as defined in table D.1 of SMPTE 2065-1, and the distance limits needed to map the entirety of a set of common camera encoding gamuts into AP1.

## Research

The [research](research) directory contains a mix of useful resources pertaining to research, experimentation and analysis conducted by the Virtual Working Group.

### Extended ACES Configuration

To review the gamut mapping model objectively, the Virtual Working Group has extended the *OpenColorIO ACES Configuration* and added the following views:

- ARRI ALF-2 (Rec.709)
- ARRI K1S1 (Rec.709)
- RED IPP2 (Rec.709)
- Filmlight TCAM (Rec.709)

Because of its size, the *complete* configuration is only available from an [external repository branch](https://github.com/colour-science/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/feature/aces_vwg_gm), however, the required LUTs and diff for the `config.ocio` file are [archived and under version control](research/resources/ocio/configurations/aces_1.2) in this repository along with the original [Filmlight Baselight grade display rendering transforms](research/resources/baselight/blg_drt/shaw).

Discussions pertaining to the configuration can be read in the [dedicated thread](https://community.acescentral.com/t/display-transform-blgs-for-nuke-for-gamut-compressor-assessment/).

### Gamut Mapping Study Models

#### Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model

[Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/rgb-saturation-gamut-mapping-approach-and-a-comp-vfx-perspective/) is built on top of the [RGB colourspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_spaces_with_RGB_primaries) with the following approach:

- An achromatic axis is computed for the scene-referred RGB exposure values.
- The pseudo-distance between the individual ùëÖ, ùê∫ and ùêµ components and the achromatic axis is compressed with a cherry-picked compression function.

The model is extremely simple and elegant while offering good computational speed.

The following implementations are available:

##### [jedypod/gamut-compress](research/repositories/jedypod)

Provides DCC implementation for :

- [Filmlight Baselight](https://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/products/baselight/overview_bl.php)
- [Autodesk Flame](https://www.autodesk.com/products/flame)
- [The Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke)
- [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)
- [Assimilate Scratch](https://www.assimilateinc.com)

Please refer to the repository [README.md](https://github.com/jedypod/gamut-compress/blob/master/README.md) file for more information.

##### [colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings](research/repositories/colour-science)

Provides Python implementation via Jupyter Notebooks.

#### Mansencal and Scharfenberg (2020) HSV Control Based Study Model

[Mansencal and Scharfenberg (2020) HSV Control Based Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/gamut-mapping-in-cylindrical-and-conic-spaces/) is built on top of the
[HSV colourspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV) with the following
approach:

- Scene-referred RGB exposure values are converted to HSV.
- The saturation component ùëÜ is compressed with a cherry-picked compression function.
- The hue component ùêª is warped according to user defined control values.
- The HSV values are converted back to scene-referred RGB exposure values and then blended with the original scene-referred RGB exposure values function through a smoothstep function.

The model is much more complex and slower but offers direct controls over hue.

The following implementations are available:

##### [colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings](research/repositories/colour-science)
