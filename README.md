# ACES - Virtual Working Group - Gamut Mapping - 2020

This repository hosts, in a version controlled location, a snapshot of the research and development effort of the [ACES Virtual Working Group on Gamut Mapping - 2020](https://community.acescentral.com/t/new-aces-working-group-gamut-mapping/).

The Virtual Working Group proposal can be read in this [document](https://community.acescentral.com/uploads/short-url/kax9E4X8dTMd9PkASqL7bz7S4qU.pdf).

A [Dropbox Workspace](https://aces.mp/GamutVWGDocs) is available as the central location for sharing resources.

## Repositories

As of this writing, *colour-science* and *jedypod* implementations do not reach parity and will yield different results because of variation in the parameterisation of the implemented gamut mapping study models.

The following repositories are available in alphabetical order:

### [colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings](https://github.com/colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings)

![Gamut Medicina 01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings/master/resources/images/Gamut_Medicina_01.png)

Provides various Python Jupyter Notebooks with implementation of the following gamut mapping study model(s):

- [Mansencal and Scharfenberg (2020) HSV Control Based Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/gamut-mapping-in-cylindrical-and-conic-spaces/) built on top of the [HSV colourspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)
- [Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/rgb-saturation-gamut-mapping-approach-and-a-comp-vfx-perspective/) built on top of the [RGB colourspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_spaces_with_RGB_primaries)

Please refer to the repository [README.rst](https://github.com/colour-science/gamut-mapping-ramblings/README.rst) file for more information.

![Resolve UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedypod/gamut-compress/master/images/screenshots/GamutCompress_resolve-ui.png)

Provides DCC implementation for [The Foundry Nuke](https://www.foundry.com/products/nuke) and [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) of the following gamut mapping study model(s):

- [Smith (2020) - RGB Saturation Study Model](https://community.acescentral.com/t/rgb-saturation-gamut-mapping-approach-and-a-comp-vfx-perspective/) built on top of the [RGB colourspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_spaces_with_RGB_primaries)
